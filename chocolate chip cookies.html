  <p> for 16 cookies. </p>
  <h2> ingredients </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> 100 grams of unsalted butter </li>
    <li> 150 grams of brown sugar </li>
    <li> 1 egg </li>
    <li> 1 tsp vanilla extract </li>
    <li> 200 grams of all purpose flour </li>
    <li> pinch of salt </li> 
    <li> 1 tsp baking soda </li>
    <li> 100 grams of chocolate chips </li>
    <li> extra chocolate chips for decoration </li>
  </ul>
  

  <h2> directions </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 170Â°C</li>
    <li>Add butter and brown sugar in a bowl and mix a few minutes until creamy. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until incorporated.</li>
    <li>Add flour, salt and baking soda and turn off the mixer once the flour is incorporated. Mix the chocolate chips into the dough.</li>
    <li>Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (but preferably overnight), then divide the dough into 16 equal pieces.</li>
    <li>Roll balls of the pieces of dough and place them on the baking sheet, allow sufficient space between the cookies. I usually need 2-3 baking sheets to bake all the cookies. Press some extra pieces of chocolate in the dough.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-14 minutes until golden brown. The cookies will be slightly soft after baking. Let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, then move them to a wire rack where they can cool completely.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2> How to store.</h2>
  <p> In a container outside the refrigerator, the cookies will remain good for 1-2 weeks. </p>
