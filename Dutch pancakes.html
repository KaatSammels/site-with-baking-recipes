  <h1> Dutch pancakes </h1>
  <img src="https://www.inlaurasbakery.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/Best-thin-Dutch-pancakes-recipe-2.jpg" alt=" Dutch pancakes" style="width:300px;height:350px;">
  <p> for 18 pancakes. </p>
  <h2> ingredients </h2>  
  <ul>
    <li> 600 grams of all purpose flour </li>
    <li> 3 eggs </li>
    <li> 1.5 liters of milk </li>
    <li> Pinch of salt </li>
  </ul>
  

  <h2> directions </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the eggs and milk in a large bowl. You can use a hand or stand mixer, but a whisk works just as well. Gradually add the dry ingredients (flour and pinch of salt) while continuing to whisk. Make sure there are no lumps in the batter.</li>
    <li>I personally prefer to bake the pancakes in a skillet with a little butter. I find that works best and the butter makes them even tastier. You can also use oil or baking spray if you feel more comfortable.</li>
    <li>Using a ladle, scoop enough batter into the center of the pan on medium heat and spread it all over the bottom by taking the pan off the heat for a moment and using a twisting, tilting motion. When the top of the pancake is dry (after 1-2 minutes), flip the pancake with a spatula and bake the other side until golden brown. Remember: the first pancake will almost always fail. But enjoy that one as you bake the rest.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2> How to store.</h2>
  <p> Dutch pancakes can be stored for 2-3 days in the fridge. </p>
